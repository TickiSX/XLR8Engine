/**
* @class BaseApp
* @brief Abstracts the main application logic and lifecycle management.
* The BaseApp class provides a framework for initializing, running, updating,
* rendering, and destroying a graphical application. It manages the main window
* and a primary circle shape, and defines the main loop structure for derived applications.
* Usage:
*   - Call init() to set up resources before running the application.
*   - Use run() to start the main loop, which handles events, updates logic, and renders frames.
*   - Override update() and render() in derived classes to implement custom behavior.
*   - Call destroy() to release resources before exiting.
*
